## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Skill Activation System

A hierarchical skill management system that evaluates user prompts to determine required organizational capabilities and enforcement levels.

Key Components:

1. Priority-Based Skill Classification
- Critical priority skills
- High priority skills
- Medium priority skills 
- Low priority skills

2. Enforcement Policy Framework
- Blocking enforcement: Prevents actions without required skills
- Suggestion based: Recommends skill acquisition
- Warning based: Notifies about missing skills

3. Skill Categorization
- Domain Skills: Core organizational capabilities
- Guardrail Skills: Protective/compliance requirements

4. Rule Evaluation Engine
- Keyword matching against prompt content
- Intent pattern recognition using regex
- Multi-source rule evaluation with precedence ordering

## Business Workflow

1. Input Processing
- Analyzes user prompts for skill requirements
- Matches against predefined skill patterns
- Evaluates both explicit keywords and intent patterns

2. Skill Resolution
- Groups matched skills by priority level
- Applies business-specific enforcement rules
- Generates prioritized skill recommendations

3. Enforcement Output
- Formats skill activation notifications
- Applies organization-specific messaging
- Delivers appropriate enforcement actions
