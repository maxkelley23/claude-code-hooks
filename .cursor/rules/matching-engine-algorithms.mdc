description: Multi-modal trigger detection for skill activation including keyword and intent pattern matching

# matching-engine-algorithms

The skill activation system implements two parallel matching mechanisms to detect when organizational skills should be triggered:

## Keyword Matching
- Direct text comparison against predefined skill keywords
- Keywords are organized by skill priority levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- Multiple keywords can be associated with a single skill

## Intent Pattern Matching
- Regex-based pattern recognition for complex activation conditions
- Supports flexible matching across different prompt formulations
- Patterns are evaluated hierarchically by skill priority

## Rule Integration Logic
- Both matching mechanisms are evaluated in parallel for each skill
- A skill is triggered if either matching condition is satisfied
- Results are grouped by priority level for final activation decision

## Domain Classification
- Skills are classified as either:
  - Domain skills (business functionality)
  - Guardrail skills (enforcement policies)
- Classification affects matching precedence and enforcement type

## Enforcement Types
- Block: Prevent execution if skill conditions not met
- Suggest: Recommend skill activation to user
- Warn: Display warning but allow continuation
